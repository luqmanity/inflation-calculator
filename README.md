# inflation-r72

This is my first project made with C!
`cleanup.py` is something I made to get rid of those pdb and other files
generated after compiling.

### Step 1
Enter the price for purchase
### Step 2
Select between 1 (check price in the future) and 2 (check price in the past)
### Step 3
Enter how many years in the past/future (depends on Step 2)

# How it works
With provided inputs, it calculates the price of the item in the past or future
corresponding to inflation - in this case, is 4.5% year over year.
Using the simple Rule 72, which at the moment means the price of an item
doubles roughly every 16 years, we'll get the year over year rate of 4.5%.
